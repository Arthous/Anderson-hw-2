            <p class= "bio">  Edward "Eddie" Brock was a disgraced journalist for the Daily Globe who bonded with a mysterious symbiote and became the supervillain known as Venom to exact revenge on his arch-nemesis Spider-Man. Over time, however Venom would soon become an anti-hero and eventually a "Lethal Protector" of the innocent. Eddie Brock has been bonded to other symbiotes such as Toxin and Anti-Venom but nevertheless it is the Venom symbiote that has stayed his most common identity. Eddie Brock/Venom's love interest is lawyer Anne Weying and his greatest archnemesis is escaped serial killer Cletus Kasady (otherwise known as Carnage). Together, Eddie Brock and Venom make a deadly combination and serve as one of Spider-Man's greatest foes in existence.</p>
